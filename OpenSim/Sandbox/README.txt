This folder holds example code that shows what we *want* to be able to do
with OpenSim in the future. The folder contains a spectrum of ideas, from
far-out explorations to nearly-complete prototypes.

There is an executable target for every
C++ file whose name begins with `future`, but these executables are not
built by default (not part of the "all" target). These executables are *not*
tests.

If you have pseudocode that you know does *not* compile, you should put it in a
file named as `pseudo*.cpp`.
