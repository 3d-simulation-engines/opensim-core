# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored

#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")

# Include configuration from the following doxyfile.
@INCLUDE = "@CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR@/doxyfile_shared"

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description 
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer 
# a quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "Application programming interface for C++ developers"

# The INTERNAL_DOCS tag determines if documentation 
# that is typed after a \internal command is included. If the tag is set 
# to NO (the default) then the documentation will be excluded. 
# Set it to YES to include the internal documentation.

INTERNAL_DOCS          = YES

# The ENABLED_SECTIONS tag can be used to enable conditional 
# documentation sections, marked by \if sectionname ... \endif.

ENABLED_SECTIONS       = developer

# The LAYOUT_FILE tag can be used to specify a layout file which will be parsed 
# by doxygen. The layout file controls the global structure of the generated 
# output files in an output format independent way. The create the layout file 
# that represents doxygen's defaults, run doxygen with the -l option. 
# You can optionally specify a file name after the option, if omitted 
# DoxygenLayout.xml will be used as the name of the layout file.

LAYOUT_FILE            = "@CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR@/doxygen-layout-developer.xml" 

# The HTML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the HTML docs will be put. 
# If a relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be 
# put in front of it. If left blank `html' will be used as the default path.

HTML_OUTPUT            = html_developer
