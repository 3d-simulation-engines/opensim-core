# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description 
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer

# The LAYOUT_FILE tag can be used to specify a layout file which will be parsed 
# by doxygen. The layout file controls the global structure of the generated 
# output files in an output format independent way. The create the layout file 
# that represents doxygen's defaults, run doxygen with the -l option. 
# You can optionally specify a file name after the option, if omitted 
# DoxygenLayout.xml will be used as the name of the layout file.

# If a relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be 
# put in front of it. If left blank `html' will be used as the default path.
