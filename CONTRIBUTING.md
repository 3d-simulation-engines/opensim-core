Guidelines for contributing to OpenSim-Core
===========================================

Outdated guidelines can be found [here](http://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8080/display/OpenSim/Contributing+to+the+OpenSim+Source+Code).

We also have [coding standards](http://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8080/display/OpenSim/OpenSim+Coding+Standards) that your contribution must follow.

Notes
-----
If you want to check memory leaks, you can have Travis-CI run valgrind on the test cases. Just put `[ci valgrind]` in your commit message.

Thank you for contributing!
